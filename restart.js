/**
 * This is a temporary file to trigger a restart of the application
 * 
 * The following fixes have been implemented to resolve ResizeObserver errors:
 * 
 * 1. Added global error handlers in index.js to prevent ResizeObserver errors from breaking the app
 * 2. Added proper component lifecycle management with unmounted refs in Dashboard and TradingChart components
 * 3. Added error handling for ResponsivePie chart rendering
 * 4. Added overflow: 'hidden' to chart containers to prevent layout shifts
 * 5. Added proper cleanup functions to useEffect hooks
 * 
 * These changes should resolve the "ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications" errors.
 * 
 * To apply these changes:
 * 1. Restart your React application
 * 2. Clear your browser cache
 * 3. If issues persist, try disabling browser extensions that might interfere with ResizeObserver
