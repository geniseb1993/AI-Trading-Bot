/**
 * Fixed ResizeObserver Loop Issues - RESTART REQUIRED
 * 
 * The following fixes have been implemented to resolve the ResizeObserver errors 
 * and continuous expanding of components:
 * 
 * 1. Fixed all chart components to use absolute positioning and fixed dimensions
 * 2. Added explicit height and width constraints to prevent layout shifts
 * 3. Added try/catch wrapping for chart rendering to prevent errors
 * 4. Replaced flexible sizing with fixed viewport-based sizing
 * 5. Added enableResponsive={false} to prevent ResponsivePie/Line from constantly resizing
 * 6. Added position: absolute with fixed dimensions for loading states
 * 7. Added overflow: hidden to prevent content from causing container growth
 * 8. Added maxHeight constraints to all components
 * 9. Removed flexGrow from components that were expanding infinitely
 * 10. Added flexShrink: 0 to prevent components from being compressed
 * 
 * To apply these changes:
 * 1. Restart your React application (completely stop and restart the dev server)
 * 2. Clear your browser cache and do a hard refresh
 * 3. If using Chrome, open Developer Tools > Network > check "Disable cache"
