# CHANGELOG - UpLiftTeck Modifications

## Version 1.0.1 (2025-03-29)

### Critical Fixes

#### Signal Engine Fix
- **Fixed buy_signal handling issue** in `signal_engine.py`
  - Modified the `extract_signals()` function to automatically create a `buy_signal` column based on `signal_score` when it's missing
  - Eliminated errors in the backtest module that were caused by missing `buy_signal` column
  - Added clear diagnostic message when creating the missing column: "Buy signal column not found. Creating it based on signal_score."

```python
# Modified code in signal_engine.py
def extract_signals(df):
    if 'buy_signal' not in df.columns and 'signal_score' in df.columns:
        print("Buy signal column not found. Creating it based on signal_score.")
        df['buy_signal'] = df['signal_score'] >= 3
    elif 'buy_signal' not in df.columns:
        print("Signal column not found. Run calculate_signals() first.")
        return pd.DataFrame()
        
    return df[df['buy_signal']][['symbol', 'time', 'close', 'volume', 'ema_9', 'ema_21', 'pct_change', 'rsi', 'macd_hist', 'signal_score', 'buy_signal']]
```

### Test Suite Additions

#### Signal Engine Tests
- Created `test_signal_engine.py` to validate the signal processing functionality:
  - Tests that `buy_signals.csv` is correctly formatted and can be loaded
  - Verifies that signals are properly processed and the `buy_signal` column works correctly
  - Ensures compatibility with the backtesting module
  - Generates a detailed report of signal distribution by symbol and score

#### Full Pipeline Tests
- Created `test_full_pipeline.py` to test the entire trading pipeline:
  - Tests data fetching functionality (with graceful failure handling)
  - Validates signal calculation logic
  - Tests extraction of buy signals directly from CSV files
  - Verifies that the fix for handling missing `buy_signal` column works correctly
  - Tests backtesting with both calculated and CSV-loaded signals

### Documentation Improvements

#### README Updates
- Enhanced documentation in `README.md` to explain:
  - Recent fixes and improvements
  - Description of test scripts and how to run them
  - Usage instructions for the full system

#### This Changelog
- Created this `CHANGELOG.md` to provide a detailed overview of all modifications

### Code Quality Improvements

- Added clear comments throughout the codebase to explain changes
- Used consistent labeling with "added or modified byUpLiftTeck" to identify changes
- Ensured graceful failure handling in test scripts
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing codebase

### Tests and Verification

All modifications have been thoroughly tested:
- The signal engine now properly handles CSV files without a `buy_signal` column
- Test scripts run successfully and provide detailed diagnostics
- All error cases are properly handled with informative messages
- The full pipeline functions correctly end-to-end

## Future Recommendations

1. **Delete temporary files**: The `fixed_signal_engine.py` file is a temporary file and could be removed.
2. **Add more test cases**: Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases.
3. **Documentation**: Consider adding more detailed documentation for each module.
4. **Error handling**: Add more robust error handling in the main pipeline.
