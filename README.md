# AI Trading Bot V2.0

An advanced AI-powered trading platform with institutional flow analysis, dark pool insights, and real-time market data.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the AI Trading Bot:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14+ and npm
- API keys for various services (see Configuration section)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

### Starting the Application

We provide several ways to start the application:

#### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended for first-time users)

```
.\quick-start.bat
```

This will:
- Install required packages
- Start the API server
- Start the React frontend

#### Option 2: Full Start with API Verification

```
.\start-all.bat
```

This will:
- Verify all API connections and environment variables
- Start the API server with real data capabilities
- Run extensive tests of API integrations
- Start the React frontend

#### Option 3: Manual Start

Start the API server:
```
python minimal_flask_server.py
```

In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
```
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following parameters:

```
# Unusual Whales API
UNUSUAL_WHALES_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Alpaca API credentials
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_key_here
ALPACA_API_SECRET=your_secret_here
ALPACA_BASE_URL=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets

# OpenRouter API for GPT-powered insights
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Hume AI API Key for voice notifications
HUME_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Application Settings
APP_ENV=production
```

## Testing API Connections

To verify your API connections are working properly:

```
python verify_api_connections.py
```

This will test:
- Environment variables
- Unusual Whales API (dark pool data)
- Alpaca API (trading)
- OpenRouter API (AI insights)
- Local server connectivity

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues:

1. Verify API connections using `verify_api_connections.py`
2. Check that all environment variables are set correctly in `.env`
3. Try running the minimal server directly: `python minimal_flask_server.py`
4. Look for error messages in the terminal windows

## Features

- Real-time market data integration
- Institutional flow analysis
- Dark pool insights
- AI-powered trading signals
- Portfolio management
- Risk management tools
- Voice notifications
- Automated trading strategies

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Option 1: Start both servers with one command

Use the provided batch file to start both the Flask backend and React frontend servers:

```
start-servers.bat
```

This will:
1. Start the Flask backend server on port 5000
2. Start the React frontend server on port 3000
3. Open browser windows for both

### Option 2: Start servers manually

#### Backend (Flask API)

```bash
cd api
python app.py
```

The Flask server will start on http://localhost:5000

#### Frontend (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # Only needed the first time
npm start
```

The React app will start on http://localhost:3000

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Audio Files Not Loading

If you encounter errors with sound files not loading:

1. Make sure the sound files exist in the correct location:
   ```
   frontend/public/sounds/access-granted-87075.mp3
   frontend/public/sounds/access-denied-101308.mp3
   ```

2. Verify file sizes are correct (they should be larger than 1KB)

3. Use the audio test page to diagnose issues:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/audio-test.html
   ```

### API 500 Errors

If you see HTTP 500 errors in the console:

1. Make sure the Flask backend is running on port 5000
2. Check that the CSV files exist in the `/api` directory:
   - buy_signals.csv
   - short_signals.csv
   - backtest_results.csv

3. Look for error messages in the Flask server console

### Backend Not Connecting

If the frontend can't connect to the backend:

1. Confirm the Flask server is running
2. Check the setupProxy.js configuration
3. Try running the app with HTTPS disabled:
   ```
   HTTPS=false npm start
   ```
